-----------------------
This part of the course was very difficult, because I went through the basics of CSS and HTML not so long ago. I did not learn anything new, but for the sake of honestly passing the course I did not allow myself to skip this part and completed all the tasks (for free). I did not proceed to paid assignments on htmlacademy, since I see no reason to pay for learning what I already know or can find in the public domain. Ahead of "responsive web design" is a topic that I look forward to.

-----------------------
After passing the first course on GIT, I was not very surprised, but now I understand how powerful this tool is and how I underestimated it. Indeed the first impression is deceptive. I am glad that now I understand this, although not completely, but I really want to move further along the course and I hope that my knowledge in GIT is enough for this. In any case, there is always someone to ask ;)

-----------------------
I had to deal with the command line before, but after a short course on the "codecademy", the device of this tool became much clearer to me.
In general, over the past 2 days, I have pretty much changed my view of rather familiar things, such as GIT, the command line, and the HTTP device. I believe that now I am ready to move on.
