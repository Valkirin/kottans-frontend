Finally completed this task. I must say that it has changed a lot. Although this is all the tip of the iceberg, I have never gone so far before in studying javascript. I liked solve tasks of ES6, data structures, but somethings like the structures of algorithms were quite difficult. Outside the course, I additionally went through regular expressions, since they were also found in algorithms. In general, I'm glad that I have passed this part and I think that I'm ready to go further.

## Responsive Web Design

I really like this theme and I will gladly use responsive web design in the future. In particular, flexbox, grid, media queries and patterns of responsive design, such as: "Off canvas", "Layout shifter", "Mostly fluid" & "Responsive design".
There is still a lot of work ahead. Getting to practice.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

This part of the course was very difficult, because I went through the basics of CSS and HTML not so long ago. I did not learn anything new, but for the sake of honestly passing the course I did not allow myself to skip this part and completed all the tasks (for free). I did not proceed to paid assignments on htmlacademy, since I see no reason to pay for learning what I already know or can find in the public domain. Ahead of "responsive web design" is a topic that I look forward to.

## Git Collaboration

After passing the first course on GIT, I was not very surprised, but now I understand how powerful this tool is and how I underestimated it. Indeed the first impression is deceptive. I am glad that now I understand this, although not completely, but I really want to move further along the course and I hope that my knowledge in GIT is enough for this. In any case, there is always someone to ask ;)

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

I had to deal with the command line before, but after a short course on the "codecademy", the device of this tool became much clearer to me.
In general, over the past 2 days, I have pretty much changed my view of rather familiar things, such as GIT, the command line, and the HTTP device. I believe that now I am ready to move on.
