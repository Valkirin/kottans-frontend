-----------------------
I had to deal with the command line before, but after a short course on the "codecademy", the device of this tool became much clearer to me.
In general, over the past 2 days, I have pretty much changed my view of rather familiar things, such as GIT, the command line, and the HTTP device. I believe that now I am ready to move on.
